# Synchronized Video Streaming Service

This project focuses on creating a new way to enjoy movies and TV shows from the comfort of your own couch with your friends and significant others halfway around the globe. Currently, there is no real way to enjoy a movie with a friend without them being present or without having to manually sync the movie on each person’s computer or television and setting up a skype call to chat. This project will help eliminate all the tedious work in setting up synchronous media playback for everyone.

This project will leverage the power of Firebase – a real time database engine - to continuously and reliably sync both clients and ensure both people enjoy the movie without any issues. The implementation leverages HTML augmented with JavaScript and HTTPS to ensure point to point security between each user. Web server and local browser cookies will be used to enhance the user experience.
